# JobSpace

### Details on the Project
JobSpace is an application that helps you organize your job applications.  Its main features include a dashboard for you to keep track of your jobs and an events page where you can schedule events such as meetups and interviews. 

The interface is simple and clean in which the user can use with ease.  

### The Thoughts behind this Project
As young professionals who are graduating bootcamp and looking to enter the job market, we felt that a platform to organize and track job applications would be really helpful. After countless hours of brainstorming ideas, JobSpace was born.
